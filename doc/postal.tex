Postal is a free and open source push notification server written in C.

\section{Introduction}

Postal is a Push Notification Server.
It supports device management and delivery of push notifications to \emph{Apple Push Notification Service (APS)}, \emph{Google Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM)}, and \emph{Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)}.
These are the services currently supported by the Apple iOS\footnote{Apple and iOS are registered trademarks of Apple, Inc.} and Google Android\footnote{Google and Android are registered trademarks of Google.} mobile device platforms.

Postal is a server that you run as part of your infrastructure.
You interact with it over an HTTP REST API.
It stores and manages devices using MongoDB\footnote{For more information on MongoDB, visit http://www.mongodb.org.}.
Optionally, you can receive events about events within Postal via the publish-subscribe mechanism of Redis\footnote{For more information on Redis, visit http://redis.io}.

\section{Installation}

Postal is designed to run on GNU/Linux, however other operating systems may be supported.

\subsection{Installing from Source}

You can fetch the most recent version of Postal from \url{https://github.com/catch/postal/downloads}.
Installation follows the typical procedures for Free and Open Source software on GNU/Linux.

Many of the configuration options seen below are not required but illustrate their use. See \verb|./configure --help| for more options.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\hrule
\begin{Terminal}
tar --lzma -xf postal-0.2.0.tar.xz
cd postal-0.2.0
./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --sysconfdir=/etc/postal --enable-redis=yes --enable-debug=minimal --enable-trace=no
make
sudo make install
\end{Terminal}

\subsection{Creating and Managing Devices}

\subsubsection{Adding a Device}

\subsubsection{Removing a Device}

\subsection{Sending Notifications}

\section{Metrics}

Many system operators will want to know what is going on with their system.
Postal provides a mechanism for being notified about events happening within the system.
This mechanism uses a \verb|PUBSUB| channel via \verb|Redis| to deliver JSON formatted events.
This feature requires that you configure Postal with \verb|--enable-redis=yes|.

\subsection{Configuration}

Metrics delivery via \verb|Redis| provides the following configuration options.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\hline
Option & Value & Description \\
\hline
enabled & \verb|true| or \verb|false| & If metric delivery is enabled. \\
host & \emph{hostname} & The hostname of the Redis server. \\
port & \verb|6379| & The port of the Redis server. \\
channel & \emph{event:postal} & The Redis PUBSUB channel name. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Redis Configuration Options}
\end{figure}

The options should be stored in the \verb|redis| group in \file{postal.conf}.
See the example below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{Terminal}
[redis]
enabled = true
host = localhost
port = 6379
channel = events:postal
\end{Terminal}
\caption{Redis Configuration Example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Events}

The following sections describe the various types of events that you may receive.

\subsubsection{Device Added}

This event is published when Postal has received a request to add a new device.

\begin{Terminal}
{
  "Action": "device-added",
  "DeviceType": "gcm",
  "DeviceToken": "12341234-12341234",
  "User": "000000000000111122223333"
}
\end{Terminal}

\subsubsection{Device Updated}

This event is published when Postal has updated the information for a device.
This could happen if an API request has been processed to change the attributes of the device.

\begin{Terminal}
{
  "Action": "device-updated",
  "DeviceType": "gcm",
  "DeviceToken": "12341234-12341234",
  "User": "000000000000111122223333"
}
\end{Terminal}

\subsubsection{Device Removed}

This event is published when Postal has been requested to remove a device.
This could happen from an API request that specifically requests the removal of a device.
This could also happen if push notifications have been disabled for a device.
Additionally, with APS, this could happen if the feedback service has requested the removal of a device.

\begin{Terminal}
{
  "Action": "device-removed",
  "DeviceType": "gcm",
  "DeviceToken": "12341234-12341234",
  "User": "000000000000111122223333"
}
\end{Terminal}

\subsubsection{Device Notified}

This event is published when Postal has successfully delivered a notification to the gateway.
This does not mean that the device has received the notification.
The various gateways to not provide this information so that is not available.

\begin{Terminal}
{
  "Action": "device-notified",
  "DeviceType": "gcm",
  "DeviceToken": "12341234-12341234",
  "User": "000000000000111122223333"
}
\end{Terminal}
